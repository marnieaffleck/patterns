						<h2>This is a title</h2>
						<p> My name is Marnie Affleck and I provide mental health counselling under the rubric Patterns, Perspectives, Practical Thinking. Currently my practice is located at Bloor and Islington, most convenient for those on the west side of the city, however I can accommodate seeing a client at another location, or during weekends or evenings, as required.</p>

					<p> I work with individuals of all ages with a wide variety of presenting problems and of varying backgrounds, including with those for whom absolute discretion is critically important.  Among my clients are those who are experiencing anxiety, depression, anger issues, crises of confidence, or struggling with loss, relationship difficulties, or differences in thinking style.  I work with individuals dealing with addiction and substance abuse problems, and help individuals manage and recover from the effects of high levels of stress, including workplace stress, traumatic stress, trauma and abuse.  I have experience working with individuals struggling with serious psychiatric disorders.</p><p>My therapeutic approach is sensitive, broad, and flexible.  I incorporate important new insights and learning from the field of neuropsychology as well as relying on solid understanding/s of long-proven effective value.  I offer friendly, non-judgmental, solution-focused, practically oriented therapy which I tailor to specifically match the person, the situation, and the need in order to optimize the effectiveness and the benefit of the counselling.  I specialize in deciphering patterns linked to the dynamics of relationship, so if this is a problem area for you, I can help.</p><p>Because I lived and worked in Montréal for many years I am in a position to offer my therapeutic counselling services en français, si vous voulez.</p>
